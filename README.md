# it-job-aggregator
The idea is to create a project which scrapes the job data, analyses it and aggregates the technologies / experience / salary.
Then it shows them on the website.

FYI: this repo is only for showcase purpose. If it wasn't, i would've never put all of the code in a single monorepo - it would be a total mess!

It will look sth like this (since it's early stage it will most probably change):
